# python-focus-group

This repository is for the LaSalle Lab Python Focus Group, where we are learning how to code using 
Python.


## Session_01
foo.txt: A file containing random phrases that was created using `touch`

bar.txt: A file containing random phases that was created using `nano`

git_test.txt: An empty file created to practice pushing files to GitHub


## Session _02
NA; worked on UNIX commands only


## Session_03
hello_world.py: A Python script that prints "Hello, World!" when run


## Session_04
comments.py: A Python script that allows comments within code

variables.py: A Python script that assigns variables and their values


## Session_05
strings.py: A Python script that represents a sequence of characters
	* Also learned escape sequences, manipulating strings and stripping spaces*


## Session_06

more_strings.py: Learned indexing, strides, length fn, find fn, replicating, concatenating, 
and other string formatting


## Session_07
numeric_types.py: Learned definitions of integars, floats and strings as well as handling complexes

type_casting.py: Learned to manipulate and assign roles

expressions.py: Learned the  Python syntax to carry out mathematical operations

complex_math.py: Learned the use of importing modules


## Session_08
typles.py: A Python script that represents an ordered sequence of elements within parentheses 
	* Learned indexing, slicing, sorting, concatenating, nesting*

lists.py: A Python script that represents an ordered sequence of elements within square brackets that has bigger potential for manipulation 
	* Learned indexing, slicing, adding/changing elements, printing elements, aliasing, cloning*

ranges.py: A Python function that returns a sequence of numbers (useful in for-loops)

## Session_09
dictionaries.py: A Python script that represents a type of collection with keys and values

set_types.py: A Python script that represents a type of collection like lists and tuples but unordered_
	* Also learned frozen sets*  
	
booleans.py: A Python data type that represents true or false
	* Learned use of boolean values in comparison and logical operators*
	
## Session_10
data_types.py: All the types include strings, integers, floats, lists, ranges, dictionaries, and Boolean type
for_loops.py: A Python function that allows for an iteration
	* Learned basic for-loops, nested for-loops, parallel for-loops*
while_loops.py: A Python function that allows for an iteration only if a condition is met
